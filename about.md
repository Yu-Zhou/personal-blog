I come from Nanjing, China. During the past twenty-something years, my footprint is Nanjing > Hangzhou > Minneapolis > Seattle > Sunnyvale. My personal interest has always being somewhat Mathematical in my whole life. Eventually, I got my PhD degree in Statistics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. And now I work as a Machine Learning Engineer in Roku's search team.
